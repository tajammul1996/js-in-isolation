## Functions

A function is a **subprogram** designed to perform a particular task and a function is an **object** in Javascript.

Functions are executed when they are called. This process is known as **invoking** a function.

Values can be passed into a function and can be used within it.

Below is an example function named as **greet**

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hi there!");
}
```

It doesn't run unless we **invoke** it and it can be **invoked** as shown below

```javascript
greet();
```

which logs **Hi there!** in the console :tada:

That was easy-peasy :sunglasses:. Now let's demystify all the things which are involved in creating a function.
